# TODO: This puzzle does not indicate that the AI has 4 Islands on the battlefield, only that it has "open mana to cast Crafty Cutpurse",
# which can be implemented alternatively with an "aimanapool" line, but then the AI sometimes misses the opportunity to cast the card, loses
# the mana forever and never casts the Cutpurse. Maybe there's a better way?
