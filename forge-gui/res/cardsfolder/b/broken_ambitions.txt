Oracle:Counter target spell unless its controller pays {X}. Clash with an opponent. If you win, that spell's controller puts the top four cards of their library into their graveyard. (Each clashing player reveals the top card of their library, then puts that card on the top or bottom. A player wins if their card had a higher converted mana cost.)
